    "Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for processing structured data, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming.\n",

    "The first step is to get familiar with different ways of accessing the Spark programming environment. In this lab, we introduce you three methods to do so (two of them run on your local computer, and the other one uses the IBM cloud platform). You are required to run this notebook on your local computer. Alternatively, The cloud platform can be utilized for the cases where you want to scale up your process.\n",

    "### 1.1 Set up a local environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses pySpark, the Python API for Spark. You should follow the following steps to install PySpark locally:\n",
    "- Install Python\n",
    "- Install Java\n",
    "- Download Spark\n",
    "- Install pyspark\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **Python** as the programming language, **Anaconda** as the virtual environment and package manager, and finally **Jupyter notebook** as the development environment. If you haven't installed Python yet, we recommend you to install it through [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/). Note that this lab is not intended to teach python programming. So, it is recommended to have some python programming background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow these steps to prepare the development environment:\n",
    "- Download Anaconda (Python 3.7 version) from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/, and install it on your machine.\n",
    "- Create an environment with Python 3.7 and use `pp_course` as the environment name. You can find information about creating and managing anaconda environments using navigator interface from https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/manage-environments/#creating-a-new-environment. You can also do it through shell commands https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html. Here is a list of useful commands:\n",
    "    - `conda create -n pp_course python=3.7`\n",
    "    - `conda env list`\n",
    "    - `source activate pp_course` for unix/mac, and `conda activate pp_course` for windows\n",
    "- Jupyter editor should be installed on your environment by default. If it is not, use Anaconda navigator to install it. To do so, first, go to the Home tab, then select pp_course environment. Finally, from the list of applications, find Jupyter Notebook, and install it. \n",
    "- Now you should be able to launch Jupyter. This launches a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open. You can also launch Jupyter using shell command. To do so, first, activate `pp_course` environment, then run the following command: `jupyter notebook`\n",
    "- Play with the interface and try to figure out its functionalities. You can find lots of useful information about notebook from the following [link](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/jupyter-notebook/latest/jupyter-notebook.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install Java\n",
    "\n",
    "You need Java installed on your machine since Spark runs on top of JVM. Download and install Java SDK 8. You can download it from the following link:\n",
    "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Add `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to your system (**Note:** This step depends on your operating system.):\n",

    "- on Windows see this [link](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-the-java_home-variable-in-windows-8895.html)\n",

    "\n",
    "https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html\n",
    "\n",
    "First, choose a Spark release, e,g, 2.4.X, and choose pre-build for Apache Hadoop, e,g, 2.7. Next, click on the download link and download the file. We recommend moving the file to your home directory, uncompress it, and maybe rename it to a shorter name such as `spark`. Now the spark file should be located here.\n",
    "\n",
    "`/your/home/directory/spark`\n",
    "\n",
    "Add `SPARK_HOME` environment variable to your system (**Note:** This step depends on your operating system):\n",
    "\n",
    "- on Unix/mac, e.g.: `export SPARK_HOME=\"/your/home/directory/spark/python\"` and then `export PATH=\"$SPARK_HOME/bin:$PATH\"`\n",
    "- on Windows: Similarly to the Java installation, set `SPARK_HOME` and add `%SPARK_HOME%\\bin` in PATH variable in System Variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"sparkinstallation2\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, launch your terminal and run the command below to test the installation.\n",

To measure the importance of a page, you are tasked to calculate `PageRank`. PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites. The PageRank algorithm is very well described in Chapter 5 of the book `Mining Massive Data Sets`. You can access the book through [this link](http://www.mmds.org/).\n",
