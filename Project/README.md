# Product recommendation system with Apache Spark
As part of the Big Data Parallel Programming (DT8034) course at Halmstad University, a project is part of the examination process of the course.  The aim of the project is to let the student apply their knowledge gathered from previous exercises in the Apache Spark framework. The student was given free hands on coming up with a project of their own, given an approval from the course supervisors.  The only requirements that had to be fulfilled where that the project code had to utilize the Apache Spark framework, run on a cloud platform and that the results would be written to a file on the platform. 

This project has been using the Amazong Customer Review Dataset (can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html)) in order to recommend products to customers.

There is a local (BDPP_project_code_local.ipynb) and cloud (project_cloud.ipynb) version of the code. The cloud version is the most updated one.

The goal of the project was to construct a recommendation system based on the Amazong Customer Review Dataset. This was done by utilizing the theory of collaborative filtering and the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) matrix factorization algorithm.
